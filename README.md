# templatepy
Template repo for python repositories & PyPi integration
---


## Usage & file overview

- `setup.py`: to install the package with `pip`, lists dependencies in `install_requires` keyword.
  - Install development version for features below with `pip install -e package[dev]` to select `extras_require` packages as well
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to run code formatting (e.g. with [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and `flake8`) and PEP compliance checks
  - Install pre-commit hook with `pre-commit install` (Note: only installs it in the current virtual environment)
- `.toml`: config for black code formatter (see above)
- `setup.cfg`: config for [bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) and `flake8` formatting (see pre-commit)
- `MANIFEST.in`: description to select included files and directories for installation (see [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-manifest-in) for details)
- `LICENSE`: legal info about sharing and using of this code
- `README.md`: markdown readme file
- `.github`: folder that contains github automation workflows and issues templates
  - workflow for linting: install pre-commit hooks locally via `pre-commit install` in the repo dir
  - workflow for uploading package to [pypi](pypi.org): (1) get pypi API key in your account, (2) add new github repo secret for actions at [https://github.com/larsrollik/templatepy/settings/secrets/actions/new](https://github.com/larsrollik/templatepy/settings/secrets/actions/new) as `TWINE_API_KEY`, (3) create new release by tagging a commit with `git tag $TAG_NAME` or on github at [https://github.com/larsrollik/templatepy/releases/new](https://github.com/larsrollik/templatepy/releases/new)
- `.gitignore`: ignored files/folders in git tools
- `package`: placeholder folder for any python package that is configured for install via `setup.py`


## TODO for adapting template to new project

- [ ] Change package name: (1) `package` folder, (2) README.md, (3) `name` argument in `setup.py`, (4) `.github/workflows` files, (5) `setup.cfg`: `[bumpversion:file:PACKAGEFOLDER/__init__.py]`
- [ ] Change details about project author, etc. in `setup.py`, `README.md`, and `package/__init__.py`
- [ ] Change license holder in `LICENSE`
- [ ] Verify inclusions/exclusions of installable files/folders in `MANIFEST.in`
- [ ] Check `.gitignore` contains relevant criteria
- [ ] Add all locations to `setup.cfg` that will contain the version string. Use same syntax as for `[bumpversion:file:PACKAGEFOLDER/__init__.py]` line to describe how to find version on version increment
- [ ] Add repository secret to upload to pypi via github action on release/commit tag (see above)
- [ ] Upload to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) if is publication: (1) Connect Zenodo to Github account, (2) Flip switch on zenodo view of repo, (3) Create new release version of github repo (tag or manual), (4) Wait! Zenodo view with DOI assignment should update within about a minute, (5) Add DOI batch to repo `README`
